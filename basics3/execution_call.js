//JS is single threaded
//while executing the code in a file, the first thing that happens is global execution context which is referred to by "this" keyword
//This "this" has different context in browser and node js environment
//in browser the global context is "window"
//There are maily three execution context in js -----global EC, Function EC, Eval EC (Eval EC IS NO THAT IMPORTANT)



//JS Executes the code in two phases -----Memory creation phase ......Execution Phase
//in memory cration phase, all the variables got the memory allocated, there is no execution but just the memory is allocated
